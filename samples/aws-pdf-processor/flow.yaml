name: PDF Processor Demo Flow
version: 1.0

comments: |
  This is a demo NiFi flow that was deployed to NiFi by B23 FlowLib.
  B23 FlowLib allows users to define NiFi flows as re-useable NiFi components
  which can be loaded into a root flow.yaml and deployed *idempotently* to a running
  NiFi instance.

  This demo flow will watch for PDF files to land in Amazon S3, download the PDFs,
  process the PDFs, and then write the parsed results back to the same S3 bucket
  in the output directory
