name: Test Data Flow
version: 1.0

  This is a sample NiFi flow to be deployed to NiFi by B23 FlowLib.
  B23 FlowLib allows users to define NiFi flows as re-useable NiFi components
  which can be loaded into a root flow.yaml and deployed *idempotently* (work in progress)
  to a running NiFi instance

# TODO: Allow Common Default properties for processors?
#   How would these be passed down and merged with child components?
# processor_defaults:
#   **nipyapi.nifi.models.processor_config_dto.processorConfigDTO

# TODO: Allow Common Defaults for connections?
#   How would these be passed down and merged with child components?
# connection_defaults:
#   **nipyapi.nifi.models.connection_dto.ConnectionDTO

# TODO: Add top-level vars that can be used globally?

# TODO: Should controllers be global or at the component level?
# similar to required_vars, we could have required_controllers

# TODO: Add support for remote_process_group Elements

# TODO: Add config for terminating unspecified relationships automatically?
#   How should we handle overriding which relationships to auto-terminate inside a component with multiple processors?
# default_auto_terminate_relationships: False

# TODO: Config for removing OutputPorts which have no downstream connections?
# A `is_terminal: bool` attribute for process_group elements so that we can skip creation of OutputPorts?
# e.g. some components will define output ports which might be unused

# TODO: Add VariableRegistry vars for Flow and for Components

# TODO: Add environment_vars list for optional env vars ?

controllers: []

canvas:
# TODO: Test a downstream connection to a component with no inputs
# TODO: Test input/output port on root canvas (currently raises exception)
